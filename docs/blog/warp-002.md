# Warp Terminal is not a proper terminal

If you are catched up with the tech space, chances are you've stumbled across the [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev/terminal) at some point. It's a terminal that they say is AI-powered and has a built-in text editor. Doesn't that remind you of not following Unix philosophy?

## Unix philosophy

Unix philosophy consist of the following principle:

* Make each program do one thing well.

Warp terminal, despite being a terminal emulator that should only give you control over your system, has a text editor AND is proprietary! It also has AI features and requires you to sign in??

## Their website

Their website is the worst part, IT DOESN'T EVEN SHOW EXAMPLES OF USING IT AS A TERMINAL! IT'S ALL JUST AI PROMPTS! And ALL the buttons, text and images are SUPER large? What happened to readability?!

And at the bottom of course there are fake quotes from random people. It even takes a while to get examples of actually using it as a terminal in the DOCUMENTATION.

## Conclusion

Warp terminal is not a proper terminal. It's a proprietary, AI-powered, text editor with a terminal. It's a disaster of modern engineering, and despite running on Unix-like systems, it doesn't follow the Unix philosophy. It's a shame, because it could have been a great terminal because it has GPU acceleration and is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

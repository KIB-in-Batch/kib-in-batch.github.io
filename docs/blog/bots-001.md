# Bots are copying random GitHub repos

If you have ever searched for "Kali in Batch" on GitHub, chances are you have stumbled across [this repository](https://github.com/cekkey/kali-in-batch).

There is VERY weird activity here, they force push an AI slop README exactly every 1 hour, which makes me think it is a bot network. The bot network is copying random GitHub repos and forcing pushing them with an AI slop README.

Probably also part of the bot network but on a different account is [this repository](https://github.com/navalraul/pkg). They force push an AI slop README, but this time every 2 hours.

There's even a [third one](https://github.com/eudes-xoxo/warp-terminal-is-bad.github.io), where they too force push an AI slop README every 1 hour.

The thing in common with all these repositories is that they all have a README file with an AI slop, force push the exact same README, and the original repos are quite niche. Also, the repos i mentioned are cloning repos made by ME.

## Possible reason for this activity

Looking at how much SEO there is, my theory is that someone is running a bot network to overshadow the original repositories of niche projects. This is not good activity.

## Links to original repos (not the copies made by the bot network)
